## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer

 Base64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in sequences of 24 bits that can be represented by four 6-bit Base64 digits which then formats into a string.

 Base64 is used to construct a JWT because it is a very popular encoding format and it's very easy to use it in most of programming languages.
